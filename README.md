# Neural Network Project
 Code and files used for the Fall 2023 Neural Network Project

The file that contains the custom environments used in the Reiforcement Learning portion of the project is SetEnvironmentEasy.py. They are tested inthe TestingSetEnvironments.py file.

For Object Detection, ImageRecognitionYOLO.py uses projectconfig.yaml for setup. The yaml file refers to the specific path to the imagenn folder, so you need that and its contents to run the model.

To see the tensorboards of the models run, use the tensorboard viewing python notebook.
